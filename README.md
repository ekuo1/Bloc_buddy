~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To clone the repo (because it is a private repo) you need to add a new ssh key.
Instructions:

On the computer you want to push code from: Run ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com" in the terminal. 
Hit enter a bunch of times (sets a blank password)
You will see that this creates a private and public key, and it will tell you where it is. 
Open the file where the public key has been saved and copy the contents of the file.

Open github on a web browser and go to your profile settings. 
Go to the tab SSH and GPG keys. Create a new SSH key. 
Paste the public key into the dialog box and hit save.

You should be able to clone the repo and push to github now.
